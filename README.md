# toyProjects
Just some projects to expand my knowledge.

# nightOfTheLivingDead
- Spawns a given number of zombie processes for a period of time.
- Fork/exec exploration

# memoryUsage:
- Exploration of when a process allocates memory and what the OS shows.

# freeMarketSocketTrade
- Spawn a cluster of processes which perform random trades over sockets.
- This is very broken/not done right now.
